# Brainstorm ideas

## Key points

- Sales teams need to report to engineering team bugs and improvements. At the moment, everything is handled using text chats with poor requirements. The idea is to find
a way to improve the process to allow Sales teams to create explanatory report for bugs and/or for new feature requests. A possible competitor / solution is https://jam.dev/
- Allow the company to customize the template for every customer, in order to have a sort of "guided" issues to open with all information needed by support team/ help desk / engineering. For example a customer A is using your product with SDK in python and customer B is just a consumer of your app/services, those two cases should provide different information when they ask for support.
- Keep track in the same tool of support ticket + developer roadmap in order to have an entire overview even for dev and customer support team and other team not directly involved.
- Reminder of a ticket after X our using mail notifications or 3rd party integration for notifications in order to keep customer up to date and never forget open tickets 


## Userbase

1. Webapp / consultings companies. Usually there are a lot of wasted time and poor documentation from the Sales team that results in unclear requirements for the dev team.
