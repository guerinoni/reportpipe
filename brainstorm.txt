Brainstorm ideas:

Use case:

1. Sales teams need to report to engineering team bugs and improvements. At the moment, everything is handled using text chats with poor requirements. The idea is to find
a way to improve the process to allow Sales teams to create explanatory report for bugs and/or for new feature requests. A possible competitor / solution is https://jam.dev/

Userbase: 

1. Webapp / consultings companies. Usually there are a lot of wasted time and poor documentation from the Sales team that results in unclear requirements for the dev team.
